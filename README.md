# Problem Statement

Assume that you are the CTO for the outsourcing firm which has been chosen to build an
admission form for the Yoga Classes which happen every month.
Requirements for the admission form are:
	- Only people within the age limit of 18-65 can enroll for the monthly classes and they will
	be paying the fees on a month on month basis. I.e. an individual will have to pay the fees
	every month and he can pay it any time of the month.
	- They can enroll any day but they will have to pay for the entire month. The monthly fee is
	500/- Rs INR.
	- There are a total of 4 batches a day namely 6-7AM, 7-8AM, 8-9AM and 5-6PM. The
	participants can choose any batch in a month and can move to any other batch next
	month. I.e. participants can shift from one batch to another in different months but in
	same month they need to be in same batch

This is a Web application built using Django Framework with the capability, and possibly even scalable to a larger crowd with some tweaks and changes!
